# WordFinder DB

This project serves as a supplementary tool for the [WordFinder](https://github.com/yoursen/WordFinder) game.

Its primary objective is to transform raw JSON word data, generated through AI, which is unordered, unsorted, and may contain duplicates, into a refined SQLite database. This database is integral to the functioning of the game.

Technical Notes:
- This project is implemented as a .NET 8 console application.
- It leverages Entity Framework for efficient database management.
